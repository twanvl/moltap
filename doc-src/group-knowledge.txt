Group knowledge

-- Sets of agents --

As a precursor to common knowledge consider knowledge in groups of agents.
For example we could write
FORMULA: group-knowledge-example
  \BB_{\{1,2,3\}} \phi  \Eq  \BB_1 \phi \et \BB_2 \phi \et \BB_3 \phi

This notation can be a useful short hand for formulas with many agents.
It will also allow us to write $\BB_{All}$ or simply $\BB$ for knowledge that ''all'' agents have.
This modal operator is commonly called E in epistemic logic.
The previous case of $\BB_i$ can be considered a subset of group knowledge among a singleton set of agents, $\BB_{{i}}$.

Just to be clear, the semantics of group knowledge are simply
FORMULA: semantics-group-1
  \BB_I \phi \EQ \forall i\in I\; \BB_i \phi
Or equivalently
FORMULA: semantics-group-2
  \begin{array}{lcl}
  M,s \models \BB_I \phi      &\EQ& \forall t\; sR_It \Imp M,t \models \phi
  \\ && \text{where } R_I = \bigcup_{i\in I} R_i
  \end{array}

-- Adjusting our rules --

For our proof system we can extend nested sequents in the same way as boxes.
So we write $[\D]_I$. This means that the box rule can stay the same:
FORMULA: rule-box-pos-group
  \prule[\BB\Pos-group]
  { \T \G, \world{\phi\Pos}_I }
  { \T \G, \BB_I \phi\Pos }

On the other hand the $\BB\Neg$ rule becomes considerably more complicated:
FORMULA: rule-box-match-group
  \prule[\BB\Neg-group]
  { \T \G, \world{\D}_{A}, \BB_{B\cup C} \phi\Neg  &  \T \G, \world{\D,\phi\Neg}_B, \BB_{B\cup C} \phi\Neg  }
  { \T \G, \world{\D}_{A\cup B}, \BB_{B\cup C} \phi\Neg }

The reason for the two sequents above the line is that $[\D]_I$ is a ''con''junction of $[\D]_i$ for each $i\inI$,
and we have no direct way of representing conjunctions in our sequents.
Only for the matching subset of agents can $\phi\Neg$ be added to the world's sequent, for the remaining agents nothing changes.

To understand this rule, remember that $\BB_{A \cup B}\phi = \BB_A\phi \et \BB_B\phi$ and also for nested sequents, $[\D]_{A \cup B} = [\D]_A \et [\D]_B$.
So we can write down the following pseudo-derivation for the $\BB\Neg-\n{group}$ rule:

FORMULA: intuition-box-match-group
  \infer[\cup\text{ for }{[\D]}]
  { \T \G, \world{\D}_{A\cup B}, \BB_{B\cup C} \phi\Neg }
  { \infer[\n{\et\Pos}]
    { \T \G, \world{\D}_{A} \et \world{\D}_{B}, \BB_{B\cup C} \phi\Neg }
    { { \T \G, \world{\D}_A, \BB_{B\cup C} \phi\Neg }
    & \infer[\cup\text{ for }\BB]
      { \T \G, \world{\D}_B, \BB_{B\cup C} \phi\Neg }
      { \infer[\n{\et\Neg}]
        { \T \G, \world{\D}_B, \BB_B \phi \et \BB_C \phi\Neg }
        { \infer[\n{\BB\Neg}]
          { \T \G, \world{\D}_B, \BB_B \phi\Neg, \BB_C \phi\Neg }
          { \infer[\cup\text{ for }\BB]
            { \T \G, \world{\D,\phi\Neg}_B, \BB_B \phi\Neg, \BB_C \phi\Neg }
            { \T \G, \world{\D,\phi\Neg}_B, \BB_{B\cup C} \phi\Neg }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
In the case that $A$ or $B$ is $\emptyset$ the left or right branch will contain $\world{\G}_\emptyset = True$,
so that branch can then be ignored.



-- Rules for restricted models --

The rules for restricted classes of models such as rule 4 and 5 become considerably more complicated.
Rule D and T on the other hand do not change at all, since in these rules the set of agents is not important.

For rules 4 and 5 it may not be possible to do something interesting beyond fully expanding the sequent to a conjunction of worlds for each single agent.
